        <h1>hypertext knowledge production mapping
            <br/>& the design process</h1>
        

        <p style={{columns: 2}}>I am designing an interactive online system that visualises the trajectory of projects, the processes of those projects and how they grow new offshoots or how they build on information from previous work. It shows how ideas flow between projects, the intertwined continuous learning opportunities, the never-ending production of knowledge. 
        <br/><br/>
        The thesis follows a case study of the collaboration between the Visual Communication Design department at Aalto and FinnGen, a genetic research project. The visual tools designed during this collaboration are all standalone works, but build upon each other to create the context for new designs. Phases of the design process can affect work outside of their particular tool. A phase in one project might inspire a solution for an issue in a different project. And when you start to look into it, all the tools are connected in some way somehow. And this is what my thesis explores. It is part research tool representation, part interactive knowledge production mapping. My research questions how to create an overview that shows all the tools and their intra- and interproject connections, to show that knowledge production does not exist in a vacuum, that one tool is simply an amalgamation of the tools, talks, research, thinking and experiences that came before it.

        The website will aid the visitor in discovering these threads between projects, so that they can follow their own path through the network depending on their interest, mapping out a road through years of lateral knowledge.
