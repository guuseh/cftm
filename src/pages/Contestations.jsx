        Contestations.AI is an interdisciplinary conference examining the societal, political, and cultural implications of artificial intelligence. Bringing together scholars, artists, and practitioners, the event challenges dominant narratives around AI and foregrounds critical perspectives on data, automation, and algorithmic governance.

        As part of developing the website for it, I created the animated header for the conference website using React and Framer Motion. The animation was designed to reflect the conferenceâ€™s themes of disruption and complexity, using abstract motion and layered elements. I focused on smooth yet unpredictable transitions to evoke a sense of dynamic tension.
