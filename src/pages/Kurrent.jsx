        Kurrent is inspired by the old German Kurrentschrift, the handwriting version of Blackletter scripts. The shapes are based on the refined, more modernised version Sutterlin that was taught as the basic handwriting in German schools from 1915 to 1941.
        In 1941, Sutterlin was removed from school curriculums by the Nazi regime and it never came back. Only the older generations still know how to write it. A strong type like this shouldn't be lost to the ages. It's graphic identity is unmatched across latin typefaces. Kurrent is a type developed as a new version of the old Sutterlin, to retain its sharp lines and delicate curves in modern times.
        This project has turned into an ongoing typeface development. Who knows when I will finish.
        Dans van de Boze Boom is an animation made to present the typeface. The text is an excerpt of a poem by Paul van Ostaaijen.
