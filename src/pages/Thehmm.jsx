        <p className="description">
            In 2021 I started my internship at The Hmm, platform for internet cultures, and after 5 months stayed on the team as a freelancer to work on various projects and disciplines over the course of now four years (and counting).
            I helped shape year-long thematic programs through events, workshops, publications, and web-based tools, supported by graphic design, research and writing. Each year we reframe our focus, building on what came before while experimenting with new ways to share research publicly and create engaging formats for conversation. It has taught me how to be comfortable with ambiguityâ€”how to slowly build something that shifts and settles, guided by dialogue, trust, and iteration.
