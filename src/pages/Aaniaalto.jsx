        <p className="description">Graphic design and web development for the 8th edition of ääniaalto, the annual sound and new media festival produced by DADA ry.
            Inspired by the theme ecotonal sonics, I tried to visualise eternal movement, sonics, nature, and interdisciplinarity, using Processing.
            The motion design inspiration came from a small tool I developed earlier that year to morph typography in relation to the Superformula.
            I worked on the visual identity, physical posters, instagram posts (together with Anh Ngo), visuals for during the festival, and the web design and development.</p>
